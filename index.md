#**Summary**
Language choice has a real and measurable eect on scientic interpretation
Sexualized language in geology creates a hostile environment conducive to
gender- and sex- based harassment
Body metaphors and personication of geologic processes can be traced
historically and are a dominant framework in interpreting geoscience
#**Motivation**
Language used in geoscience sets culture and tone for behavioral norms
How might metaphors used in geoscience contribute to the prevalence of
gender- and sex- based harassment?
# How language shapes culture
The structure of language can shape our world view,
bounding how we communicate our human emotions or
even the color of the sea. Scholars in disciplines varying

from archeology to neuroscience have shown that the as-
sumptions we make about objects of scientic inquiry, es-
pecially related to the names assigned, can have real ef-
fects for our understanding of scientic processes. For

example, preconceived notions of the passivity of the
female egg signicantly delayed scientistsâ€™ understanding
of the active chemical role that eggs play in conception.

Evidence suggests metaphors used for scientic process-
es actually impact how we perceive their importance or

urgency.

#**Geology language and sexual harassment**

The use of sexually explicit language in geology and the eld is not just exclusive or

oensive, it creates real and physical danger. This kind of language constitutes gen-
der-based harassment, and violates university policies in compliance with Title IX6.

The eld is known to be a dangerous place for women and other underrepresented

groups. In a 2014 study surveying eldwork scientists, 71% of women reported ex-
periencing harassment and 26% reported experiencing physical assault7. According

to a report by the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, under-
representation of women in authority and the acceptance of hostile environments

increases likelyhood of sex and gender-based harassment and assault6.
