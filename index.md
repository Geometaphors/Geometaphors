The structure of language can shape our world view,
bounding how we communicate our human emotions or
even the color of the sea1. Scholars in disciplines varying

from archeology to neuroscience have shown that the as-
sumptions we make about objects of scientic inquiry, es-
pecially related to the names assigned, can have real ef-
fects for our understanding of scientic processes2,3. For

example, preconceived notions of the passivity of the
female egg signicantly delayed scientistsâ€™ understanding
of the active chemical role that eggs play in conception4.

Evidence suggests metaphors used for scientic process-
es actually impact how we perceive their importance or

urgency.
