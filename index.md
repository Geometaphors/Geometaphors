**Summary**

Language choice has a real and measurable effect on scientic interpretation
Sexualized language in geology creates a hostile environment conducive to
gender- and sex- based harassment. Body metaphors and personification of geologic processes can be traced
historically and are a dominant framework in interpreting geoscience.

**Motivation**

Language used in geoscience sets culture and tone for behavioral norms.
How might metaphors used in geoscience contribute to the prevalence of
gender- and sex- based harassment?

**How language shapes culture**

The structure of language can shape our world view,
bounding how we communicate our human emotions or
even the color of the sea. Scholars in disciplines varying from archeology to neuroscience have shown that the assumptions we make about objects of scientic inquiry, especially related to the names assigned, can have real effects for our understanding of scientic processes. For
example, preconceived notions of the passivity of the female egg signicantly delayed scientistsâ€™ understanding
of the active chemical role that eggs play in conception. Evidence suggests metaphors used for scientic process-
es actually impact how we perceive their importance or urgency.

**Geology language and sexual harassment**

The use of sexually explicit language in geology and the field is not just exclusive or ofensive, it creates real and physical danger. This kind of language constitutes gender-based harassment, and violates university policies in compliance with Title IX. The field is known to be a dangerous place for women and other underrepresented groups. In a 2014 study surveying eldwork scientists, 71% of women reported experiencing harassment and 26% reported experiencing physical assault7. According to a report by the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, underrepresentation of women in authority and the acceptance of hostile environments increases likelyhood of sex and gender-based harassment and assault.
